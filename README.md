# Lib Matrix Math: A high-performance C library for efficient Linear Algebra computations, providing essential functionality for matrix and vector operations.

Welcome to the C Matrix Math Library, your go-to solution for implementing Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks in C. This library provides a set of powerful tools and utilities to seamlessly integrate LSTM functionality into your C projects, enabling you to tackle complex deep learning tasks with ease.

Unlock the power of Long Short Term Memory networks in C with our high-performance library. Seamlessly implement advanced deep learning architectures for time-series analysis, natural language processing, and more. Empower your projects with state-of-the-art memory retention and predictive capabilities, thanks to our intuitive and efficient API.

### Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Perform common matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.
- **Vector Operations**: Efficiently handle vector manipulations including dot product, cross product, and vector scaling.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples are provided to help you get started quickly and easily.
- **Open Source**: The library is open source and actively maintained, allowing for community contributions and enhancements.

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make build system (optional)

### Getting Started

To get started with the C Matrix Math Library, simply clone the repository and follow the installation instructions provided in the `README.md` file. Once installed, explore the documentation and examples to start incorporating LSTM functionality into your C projects.

#### Example Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use CMatrixMath to perform matrix multiplication:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "matrix.h"

int main() {
    // Define matrices A and B
    double A_data[2][2] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
    double B_data[2][2] = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};
    Matrix A = create_matrix_from_array(2, 2, (double*)A_data);
    Matrix B = create_matrix_from_array(2, 2, (double*)B_data);

    // Perform matrix multiplication: C = A * B
    Matrix C = matrix_multiply(A, B);

    // Print the result
    printf("Result of A * B:\n");
    print_matrix(C);

    // Free allocated memory
    free_matrix(A);
    free_matrix(B);
    free_matrix(C);

    return 0;
}
```
